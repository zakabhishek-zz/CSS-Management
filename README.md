PART I – CSS Management
Objective
1. Effective use of CSS that displays / hides certain elements in the
data grid – based on selection (More or Less)
2. Create DIV based Data Grid. (Possibly avoid Flex-box)
Technology
1. Use of JS MVC frameworks is okay; however, try using vanilla
JavaScript to the max. (Bonus+)
2. Use pure CSS. Do not use Bootstrap or Foundation.
3. Organize code by commenting and separating view and logic.
Instructions
1. Create the Data Grid with the JSON. Use of JSON is at your
convenience.
2. Create the Options Selector – that has two options More and Less.
a. More – Displays Two Rows in specific cells (based on JSON
format)
b. Less – Displays Only one row.
3. Implement sorting (Descending and Ascending) upon clicking the
column header.
a. First click – Applies Descending Order.
b. Second click – Ascending Order.
c. Or vice-versa. (Bonus)
